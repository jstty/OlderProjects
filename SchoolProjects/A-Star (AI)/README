[Compiling]
In the root(same directory as this file) run make.
> make

[Source]
All the source code is located in the "source" directory.
"global.h" includes all the required dependent classes. All cpp files include this file instead of including all the required files.
"main.cpp" is the entry point and instantiates the Map and Astar class.
"map.cpp" and "map.h" loads/gives access to the map data, this to abstract the real map from the A* algorithm. It allows the Astar class to call a dynamic map.
"astar.cpp" and "astar.h" implement the A* algorithms(recursive forward, backwards, larger/smaller g-value, and adaptive).

[Dependancies]
The STL(Standard Template Library)

[Running]
Upon compiling the executable is create in the "output" directory.
Change to this directory and run the executable
> cd <project dir>/output
> ./Astar -i inputfile0.txt

[Command line]
Format: Astar -i <filename> [-A] [-backwards] [-smallg] [-noprint-search] [-print-timestep]
                            [-m <number> (filename is the string format)]
Examples:
   Forward   A*           > Astar -i inputfile0.txt
   Adaptive  A*           > Astar -i inputfile0.txt -A
   Backwards A*           > Astar -i inputfile0.txt -backwards
   Favor Smaller G-Value  > Astar -i inputfile0.txt -smallg
   Don't Display Searches > Astar -i inputfile0.txt -noprint-search
   Display Time Step      > Astar -i inputfile0.txt -print-timestep
   Multiple files & Don't Display Searches > Astar -i inputfile%d.txt -m 2 -noprint-search

All flags can be used at the same time with the exception of "-noprint-search" and "-print-timestep".
"-noprint-search" will NOT print search AND time steps.
